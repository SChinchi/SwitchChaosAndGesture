# SwitchChaosAndGesture

Bottled Chaos and Gesture of the Drowned switch item tiers. 

Bottled Chaos' random nature and Gesture of the Drowned's ineffective drawback make the items feel misclassified. With a few behavioral tweaks they can truly be Lunar and Legendary items respectively.

## Features

### Bottled Chaos
- Add 20% of the equipment cooldown of each additional effect activated. Configurable.

### Gesture of the Drowned
- Config option to prevent it from automatically activating certain equipment.
  - Enabled by default for Recycler, The Crowdfunder, Trophy Hunter's Tricorn, and Volcanic Egg.
- Config option to remove Gesture of the Drowned from the item pool if playing with the item is not your preference.
- Config option to AI blacklist the item as Scavengers can be more dangerous.

### Models
The sprites and models have been changed to better reflect their respective item tiers. Any help to make the sprites cleaner or better would be appreciated.
